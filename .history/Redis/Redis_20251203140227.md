What is Babel, in Simple Terms?  
--------------------------------

Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Its main job is to transform code.

In this time (2025) we developers write modern Javascript code (ES6+) , bable translate our modern codes into  old  Javascript,  so  that  old 
version browser which doesnt support latest Javascript, can run latest website.

Example => There is a browser internet explorer running on windows xp or windows 7, which support old version of Javascript. The new   website
           which is built on ES6+, can be ran in that old internet explorer. So, Bable translates new version code into  old  version  of code
