What is ESLint?
=> In simple terms, ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. 
   Think of it as a highly configurable spell-checker and grammar coach for your code.



Purpose ? 
=> Its primary purpose is to make your code more consistent and avoid bugs by catching errors and enforcing a 
   specific  coding style before you even run the code.



How It Works ?
=> ESLint first parses your code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is a structured, machine-readable representation 
   of your code's logic and patterns. It then traverses this AST, looking at every node (like variables, functions, 
   loops, etc.).
    
    Rule Checking: As it traverses, it applies a set of rules to the nodes. A rule is a specific check, like "are there any unused variables?" or "is there a missing semicolon?".

Reporting: If a rule is violated, ESLint reports it as a problem. These problems can be flagged as:

Error: (Severity 2) A serious problem that usually breaks code or is a potential bug. Will often cause a non-zero exit code, which is useful for continuous integration pipelines.

Warning: (Severity 1) A stylistic issue or something that's not critical but should be fixed for consistency.
